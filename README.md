## Install

> Have Helm 3 [installed](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install).

```sh
helm repo add windmill https://windmill-labs.github.io/windmill-helm-charts/
helm install mywindmill windmill/windmill -n windmill --create-namespace --values values.yaml
```

To update versions:

```
helm repo update windmill
helm upgrade mywindmill windmill/windmill -n windmill --values values.yaml
```

You do not need to provide a values.yaml to be able to test it on minikube.
Follow the steps below.

> **⚠️ Note:**  
> The 3.X release introduces a breaking change due to the migration of the demo PostgreSQL and demo MinIO from Bitnami subcharts to the vanilla MinIO subchart and vanilla non-persistent PostgreSQL pods.  
> These demo services are intended **only for testing or demo purposes** and should **not** be used in production environments under any circumstances and are not made persistent



### Postgres instance

The default helm charts enable a postgresql database by default. It should only be used for **demo** or **testing** purposes. It's not persistent, you should use a managed database instance like RDS or have experience managing a real postgres setup on Kubernetes and point the databaseUrl to that.

### When using a non super-user role for postgresql in databaseUrl

You will need to setup some required roles which would otherwise be done
automatically when using a super-user role for the databaseUrl.

Follow those
[instructions](https://docs.windmill.dev/docs/advanced/self_host#run-windmill-without-using-a-postgres-superuser)

### Running windmill pods as non-root user

By default the windmill pods run as `root`. You can opt to run the pods as
non-root by setting uid: 1000

```
windmill
  app
    podSecurityContext:
      runAsUser: 1000
      runAsNonRoot: true
```

### Test it on minikube

To make it work on a local minkube to test. Get the ip address of the ingress:

```
▶ kubectl get ingress -n windmill
NAME       CLASS    HOSTS                        ADDRESS        PORTS   AGE
windmill   <none>   windmill,windmill,windmill   192.168.49.2   80      13m
```

If no ip address displayed, enable the ingress addon:

```
minikube addons enable ingress
```

Then modify /etc/hosts to match the `baseDomain`, by default 'windmill'.

E.g:

```
192.168.49.2   windmill
```

Then open your browser at <http://windmill>

Even if you setup oauth, login as** admin@windmill.dev **/ changeme to setup the
instance & accounts and give yourself admin privileges.

## Local S3

The chart includes a Minio S3 distribution to demonstrate the usage of S3 as a
resource in a vendor-agnostic environment like Kubernetes. The local Minio S3
service will be available to the Windmill workers through its Kubernetes
service, which is set to "windmill-minio" by default. In the Resources page, you
should create an S3 API Connection Object, and import it as a connection object
to reduce code duplication between scripts. For the sake of this example, this
stage is skipped. Below is an example of how to authenticate and use the
provided local S3 distribution in a Python script running in Windmill:

```python
from minio import Minio

def main():
    # Create a client with the MinIO server, its access key
    # and secret key.
    client = Minio(
        "windmill-minio", # Local Kubernetes Service
        access_key="windmill",
        secret_key="windmill",
    )

    # Make 'demo' bucket if not exist.
    found = client.bucket_exists("demo")
    if not found:
        client.make_bucket("demo")
    else:
        print("Bucket 'demo' already exists")

    with open('readme.txt', 'w') as f:
        f.write('Create a new text file!')

    client.fput_object(
        "demo", "readme.txt", "readme.txt",
    )

    print(
        "'readme.txt' is successfully uploaded as "
        "object 'readme.txt' to bucket 'demo'."
    )
```

## Enterprise features

To use the enterprise version with the <license key> provided upon subscription,
add the following to the values.yaml file:

```
enterprise:
  enabled: true
```

Then go to the superadmin settings -> instance settings -> license key and set
your license key

### S3 Cache

Enterprise users can use S3 storage for dependency caching for performance
reasons at high scale (use only with #workers > 20). Cache is two way synced at
regular intervals (10 minutes). To use it, the worker deployment requires access
to an S3 bucket. There are several ways to do this:

1. On AWS (and EKS) , you can use a service account with IAM roles attached. See
   [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/associate-service-account-role.html) -
   once you have a policy , you can create an account via eksctl for instance

   ```sh
   eksctl create iamserviceaccount --name serviceaccountname --namespace production --cluster windmill-cluster --role-name "iamrolename" \ --attach-policy-arn arn:aws:iam::12312315:policy/bucketpolicy --approve
   ```

2. Mount/attach a credentials file in `/root/.aws/credentials` of the worker
   deployment
3. Add environment variables for the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
   `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, via kube secrets.

The sync relies on rclone and uses its methods of authentication to s3 per
[Rclone documentation](https://rclone.org/s3/#authentication)

Then the values settings become:

```
enterprise:
  enabled: true
  enabledS3DistributedCache: true
  s3CacheBucket: mybucketname
```

## Caveats

- Postgres is included for demo purposes, it is a stateful set with a small
  volume claim applied. If you want to host postgres in k8s, there are better
  ways, or offload it outside your k8s cluster. Postgres can be disabled
  entirely in the values.yaml file.
- The postgres user/pass is currently not a secret/encrypted

## Kubernetes Hosting Tips

### Ingress configuration

The helm chart does have an ingress configuration included. It's enabled by
default. The ingress uses the `windmill.baseDomain` variable for its hostname
configuration. Here are example configurations for a few cloud providers.

It configures the HTTP ingress for the app, lsp and multiplayer containers. The
configuration (except for plain nginx ingress) also exposes the windmill app
SMTP service for email triggers on a separate IP address/domain name. This is
the IP address/domain name you need to point your MX/A records to, learn more
[here](https://www.windmill.dev/docs/advanced/email_triggers).

### AWS ALB

```yaml
windmill:
  baseDomain: "windmill.example.com"
  app:
    smtpService:
      enabled: true
      annotations:
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: "external"
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-nlb-target-type: "ip"
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-scheme: "internet-facing"
        # # for static ip (more info on https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.7/guide/service/annotations/#eip-allocations):
        # service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-eip-allocations: eipalloc-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,eipalloc-yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
    ...
  ...
...

ingress:
  className: "alb"
  annotations:
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internet-facing
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/tags: Environment=dev,Team=test
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: ip
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-group-attributes: stickiness.enabled=true,stickiness.lb_cookie.duration_seconds=604800,stickiness.type=lb_cookie
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/load-balancer-attributes: idle_timeout.timeout_seconds=600
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/group.name: windmill
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/group.order: '10'
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/certificate-arn: my-certificatearn
```

### GCP + GCE LB + managed certificates

```yaml
windmill:
  baseDomain: "windmill.example.com"
  app:
    service:
      annotations:
        cloud.google.com/backend-config: '{"default": "session-config"}'
    smtpService:
      enabled: true
      annotations:
        cloud.google.com/l4-rbs: "enabled"
        # # for static ip (more info on https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/service-load-balancer-parameters#spd-static-ip-parameters):
        # networking.gke.io/load-balancer-ip-addresses: <REGIONAL_IP_NAME>
  lsp:
    service:
      annotations:
        cloud.google.com/backend-config: '{"default": "session-config"}'

ingress:
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "gce"
    kubernetes.io/ingress.global-static-ip-name: <GLOBAL_IP_NAME>
    networking.gke.io/managed-certificates: managed-cert
```

Replace `<GLOBAL_IP_NAME>` with the name of a global static IP address you've
created in GCP.

In addition to the above, you will need to apply the following resources for
session affinity and managed certificates:

```yaml
apiVersion: cloud.google.com/v1
kind: BackendConfig
metadata:
  name: windmill-backendconfig
spec:
  sessionAffinity:
    affinityType: "GENERATED_COOKIE"
    affinityCookieTtlSec: 86400 # max
```

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.gke.io/v1
kind: ManagedCertificate
metadata:
  name: managed-cert
spec:
  domains:
    - windmill.example.com
```

### Azure + app routing + keyvault certificate

```yaml
windmill:
  baseDomain: "windmill.example.com"
  app:
    smtpService:
      enabled: true
      # # for static ip (more info on https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/static-ip):
      # annotations:
      #   service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pip-name: <myAKSPublicIP>
ingress:
  annotations:
    kubernetes.azure.com/tls-cert-keyvault-uri: <KeyVaultCertificateUri>
  className: webapprouting.kubernetes.azure.com
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - "windmill.example.com"
      secretName: keyvault-windmill
```

You can find more details about SSL certificates with webapprouting in Azure
[here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/app-routing-dns-ssl).

### NGINX ingress + cert-manager:

```yaml
windmill:
  baseDomain: "windmill.example.com"
  ...

ingress:
  className: "nginx"
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - "windmill.example.com"
      secretName: windmill-tls-cert
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity: "cookie"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity-mode: "persistent"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-name: "route"
...
```

You will also need to install cert-manager and configure an issuer. More details
[here](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/#default-static-install) and
[here](https://cert-manager.io/docs/tutorials/acme/nginx-ingress/#step-6---configure-a-lets-encrypt-issuer).
Cert-manager can also be used with the other cloud providers.

## Extra Deploy

The `extraDeploy` parameter allows you to deploy additional arbitrary Kubernetes resources alongside Windmill. This is particularly useful for deploying External Secrets, ConfigMaps, custom Services, or any other Kubernetes resources that your Windmill deployment might need.

Add the `extraDeploy` array to your values.yaml file with the Kubernetes resources you want to deploy:

```yaml
extraDeploy:
  - apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
    kind: ExternalSecret
    metadata:
      name: windmill-database-secret
      namespace: windmill
    spec:
      refreshInterval: 1h
      secretStoreRef:
        name: vault-backend
        kind: SecretStore
      target:
        name: windmill-db-credentials
        creationPolicy: Owner
      data:
      - secretKey: DATABASE_URL
        remoteRef:
          key: database/windmill
          property: url
```

Then reference the created secret in your Windmill configuration:

```yaml
windmill:
  databaseUrlSecretName: windmill-db-credentials
  databaseUrlSecretKey: DATABASE_URL
```

### Tailscale with TLS

```yaml
ingress:
  enabled: false
windmill:
  baseDomain: "mywindmill.example.ts.net"
  ...
```

You will also need to install the [tailscale operator](https://tailscale.com/kb/1236/kubernetes-operator)

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: windmill
  namespace: windmill
spec:
  ingressClassName: tailscale
  rules:

  - host: mywindmill
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: windmill-lsp
            port:
              number: 3001
        path: /ws/
        pathType: Prefix
  - host: mywindmill
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: windmill-app
            port:
              number: 8000
        path: /
        pathType: Prefix
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - mywindmill
```

### Generic

There are many ways to expose an app and it will depend on the requirements of
your environment. If you don't want to use the included ingress and roll your
own, you can just disable it. Overall, you want the following endpoints
accessible included in the chart:

- windmill app on port 8000
- lsp application on port 3001
- metrics endpoints on port 8001 for the app and workers (ee only)
- windmill app smtp service on port 2525 for email triggers (need to be exposed
  on port 25)

If you are using Prometheus and if the enterprise edition is enabled, you can
scrape the windmill-app-metrics service on port 8001 at /metrics endpoint to
gather stats about the Windmill application.

### Docker dind configruation

If you don't want to run Docker using the host's Docker engine, you can use
Docker-in-Docker (dind). Below is the configuration:

```yaml
windmill:
  workerGroups:
    - name: "docker"
      replicas: 2
      volumes:
        - emptyDir: {}
          name: sock-dir
        - emptyDir: {}
          name: windmill-workspace
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/run
          name: sock-dir
        - mountPath: /opt/windmill
          name: windmill-workspace
      extraContainers:
        - args:
            - --mtu=1450
          image: docker:27.2.1-dind
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          name: dind
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: "1000m"
            limits:
              memory: "2Gi"
          securityContext:
            privileged: true
          terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
          terminationMessagePolicy: File
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /opt/windmill
              name: windmill-workspace
            - mountPath: /var/run
              name: sock-dir
```

NOTE: the `windmill-workspace` volumeMount is used to share files between the
dind container and the worker container.

### Host Aliases

You can configure custom DNS mappings for pods to access internal services or resolve domain issues:

```yaml
windmill:
  # Global for all pods
  hostAliases:
    - ip: "10.0.0.100"
      hostnames:
        - "internal-registry.company.com"
  
  # Per worker group
  workerGroups:
    - name: "default"
      hostAliases:
        - ip: "10.0.0.101"
          hostnames:
            - "private-pypi.company.com"
```

See [Kubernetes hostAliases documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/network/customize-hosts-file-for-pods/) for more details.
